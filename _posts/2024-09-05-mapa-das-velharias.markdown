**Mapa das Cooperativas Portuguesas** (portuguese for Portuguese cooperatives map) is a webmap of active and historical cooperatives in Portugal. Cooperatives are businesses owned by “member-owners”. They are democratically controlled by their member-owners, and unlike a traditional business each member gets a voice in how the business is run. This is a work in progress, meaning that the map will be updated as frequently as possible.

In the future, the dataset will be shared at [A-GeoCat](https://a-geocat.alfobre.com/).

All suggestions,fixes and additions are welcome. For any questions and/or comments, please use projeto.alfobre@gmail.com
