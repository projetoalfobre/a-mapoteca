**Mapa das Velharias (e antiguidades)** (portuguese for **Old stuff (and antiques) Map**) is a webmap featuring antique fairs and flea markets in Portugal. Most locations are collected from online sources (e.g. blog posts, news articles, social media) but some were verified on site. 

This project is a work in progress, meaning that the map will be updated as frequently as possible. Meanwhile, you can visit the map [here](https://projetoalfobre.github.io/mapa-das-velharias/).

Future plans include expanding additional information and sharing the dataset at [A-GeoCat](https://a-geocat.alfobre.com/).

All suggestions, fixes and additions are welcome. For any questions and/or comments, please use projeto.alfobre@gmail.com
