**Mapa da Arqueologia em Portugal** (portuguese for **Map of Archaeology in Portugal**) is a webmap about the portuguese archaeology landscape. The map features companies, schools, research units, etc.

This project is a work in progress, meaning that the map will be updated as frequently as possible. Meanwhile, you can visit the map [here](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/mapa-da-arqueologia-em-portugal_1092410). 
 
Future plans include expanding additional information and sharing the dataset at [A-GeoCat](https://a-geocat.alfobre.com/).

All suggestions,fixes and additions are welcome. For any questions and/or comments, please use projeto.alfobre@gmail.com
