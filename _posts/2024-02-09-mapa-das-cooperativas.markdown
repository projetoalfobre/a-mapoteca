**Mapa das Cooperativas Portuguesas** (portuguese for **Portuguese Cooperatives Map**) is a webmap of active and historical cooperatives in Portugal. Cooperatives are businesses owned by “member-owners”. They are democratically controlled by their member-owners, and unlike a traditional business each member gets a voice in how the business is run. 

Primary (but not the only) source of data is the [[https://cases.pt/|Cooperativa António Sérgio para a Economia Social]].

This project is a work in progress, meaning that the map will be updated as frequently as possible. Meanwhile, you can visit the map [here](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/mapa-das-cooperativas-portuguesas_1021529#7/39.309/-8.042). 
 
Future plans include expanding additional information and sharing the dataset at [A-GeoCat](https://a-geocat.alfobre.com/).

All suggestions,fixes and additions are welcome. For any questions and/or comments, please use projeto.alfobre@gmail.com
