This is an online map of portuguese cooperatives. Cooperatives are businesses owned by “member-owners”. They are democratically controlled by their member-owners, and unlike a traditional business each member gets a voice in how the business is run. 

It's a work in progress and a collective project, meaning that more than one person is currently working on it. It will be updated according to the plan below and as frequently as possible.

- [x]  Collect the cooperatives list provided by the [CASES - António Sérgio Cooperative for the Social Economy](https://cases.pt)
- [ ]  v1.0 Georeference the addresses from the above list by sector (ongoing) 
- [ ]  Add historical cooperatives

When we reach the v1.0, dataset will be shared at [A-GeoCat](https://a-geocat.alfobre.com/)
