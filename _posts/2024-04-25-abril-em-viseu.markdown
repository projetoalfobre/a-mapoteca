**Abril em Viseu** (portuguese for **April in Viseu**) is an online map about events and people from Viseu that are somehow related to the [Carnation Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnation_Revolution) in Portugal. 

You can visit the map [here](https://abrilemviseu.pt/).

This is a collective project and a work in progress. This means that it will be updated as frequently as possible and that more than one person is currently working on it. 

Future plans include expanding additional information and sharing the dataset at [A-GeoCat](https://a-geocat.alfobre.com/).

All suggestions, fixes and additions are welcome. For any questions and/or comments, please use projeto.alfobre@gmail.com or abrilemviseu@gmail.com
