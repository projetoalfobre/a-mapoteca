**Abril em Viseu** (portuguese for April in Viseu) is an online map about events and people from Viseu that are somehow related to the [Carnation Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnation_Revolution) in Portugal. It's a work in progress and a collective project. This means that it will be updated as frequently as possible and that more than one person is currently working on it.

The map content is available in portuguese only and you can visit the map [here](https://abrilemviseu.pt/).
