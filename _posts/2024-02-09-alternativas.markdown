**Alternativas - outros caminhos para a vida** (portuguese for **Alternatives - other paths to life**) is a webmap about alternative living options. The map features projects (businesses, collectives, cooperatives, etc.) that show that it's possible to innovate, to disrupt, to make a living, without being profit-driven. 

This project is a work in progress, meaning that the map will be updated as frequently as possible. Meanwhile, you can visit the map [here](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/alternativas-outros-caminhos_1021352#7/39.623/-6.614).

Future plans include expanding additional information and sharing the dataset at [A-GeoCat](https://a-geocat.alfobre.com/).

All suggestions, fixes and additions are welcome. For any questions and/or comments, please use projeto.alfobre@gmail.com
