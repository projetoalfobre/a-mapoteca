This is a webmap about other ways of living. We map projects, businesses, collectives and cooperatives that show that it's possible to innovate, to disrupt, to creat evalue, to make a living, without being profit-driven. 

It's a work in progress and a collective project, meaning that more than one person is currently working on it. It will be updated according to the plan below and as frequently as possible.

- [ ] Collect 20 portuguese examples (ongoing)
- [ ] Collect 20 non-portuguese examples
- [ ] v1.0 Organize data by layers and categories  
- [ ] Add new examples

When we reach the v1.0, dataset will be shared at [A-GeoCat](https://a-geocat.alfobre.com/)
