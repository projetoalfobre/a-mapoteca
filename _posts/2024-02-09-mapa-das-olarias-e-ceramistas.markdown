This is an online map about portuguese potters and potteries. It's a work in progress and a collective project, meaning that more than one person is currently working on it.  It will be updated according to the plan below and as frequently as possible.

- [x] Collect the artists list provided by the [Portuguese Association of Cities and Villages of Ceramics](https://ceramicadeportugal.pt/)
- [ ] v1.0 Georeference the addresses of the shops/artists from the above list (ongoing)
- [ ] Add new artists/shops

When we reach the v1.0, dataset will be shared at [A-GeoCat](https://a-geocat.alfobre.com/)
