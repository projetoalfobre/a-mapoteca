**Ceramistas e Oleiros de Portugal** (portuguese for Portuguese ceramists and potters) is a webmap featuring portuguese ceramists and potters.

This project is a work in progress, meaning that the map will be updated as frequently as possible. Meanwhile, you can visit the map [here](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/ceramistas-e-oleiros-de-portugal_1021961#7/40.019/-6.976). 

Future plans include expanding additional information and sharing the dataset at [A-GeoCat](https://a-geocat.alfobre.com/).
